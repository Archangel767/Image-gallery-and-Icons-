## Code Review
- A small bug I ran into was my inability to reduce the gap size between the grid tiles no matter what value I tried to adjust.
- For some reason, I had put the figure elements into an unordered list, which created unmodifiable "intendations" in the grid. I removed the list elements and adjusted the styling accordingly.
- Everything started to work more predictably, and I learned that I need to stop jacking random code I find on the internet.
